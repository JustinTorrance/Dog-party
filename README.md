# Dog-party
Overview
It’s a dog party! The reality is, as a frontend developer, you’re going to be building out a lot of the UI on websites and apps. This can be a lot of fun, and you definitely want to get good at it! One of the beginning pieces is using semantic html and writing clean CSS. Similar to what you might do in a job, you’ve got a comp and need to build it out.

Steps to setup
Using your terminal, create a directory called dog-party
Inside of your dog-party directory, create a sub-directory called images
Also create two files called index.html and styles.css
You will also need to download the assets and insert them into your images directory
Note: Do not use CSS flex-box or grid for this project (If you don’t know what this is, no worries. You’ll learn more about this in the future!)

Next Steps
Start out focusing on the HTML using semantic tags and creating a clean structure.
Then focus on styling your site like a boss :smirk:
Finally, create a README.md file making sure to include the comp as well as a picture of your site
